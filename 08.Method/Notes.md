# Methods in Java
*	A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.
*	It is used to achieve the reusability of code. 
*	We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. 
*	The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.
