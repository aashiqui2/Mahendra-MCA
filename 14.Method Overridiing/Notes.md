* we cannot use this or super in static areas
* super --> Super class instance
* super() -->Explicit call of super class constructor
* super(500)-->explicit call of super class Constructor

In method overriding, visibility of the method -should not be reduced.it can be maintained or it can be increased

# Same method Signature:
Return Datatype: Same or Covarient return Datatype: 


# Access Modifiers:
private < package-private < protected < public
parent                          Child
Work()(package-private)         work()
                                protected work()
                                public work()

protected work()                protected work()
                                public work()

public work()                   public work()



# Why do we need Method Overriding?
Child wants to have its Own definition.




# Covarient return Datatype:
Visibility should not be reduced
