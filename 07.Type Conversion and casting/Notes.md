# Types of Type Casting in Java
* Widening Type Casting (implicit)
* Narrowing Type Casting (explicit)


# Widening Type Casting
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double  (From left to right: Lower data type to Higher data type)

## Syntax :
  larger_data_type variable_name = smaller_data_type_variable;



# Narrowing Type Casting
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte  (From left to right: Higher data type to Lower data type)

# Syntax :
