abstract class -abstract method:
if we have abstarct method in a class then definitely the class is abstract,Recursive is not true.

method:


An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€”it may or may not

but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed, 
the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods
in its parent class.
