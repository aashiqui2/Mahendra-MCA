# class
* Class is a template or a blueprint.
* it is a logical entity.
* Class is a container.
* Class does not occupy space.
* class is a collection of object.
* Class defines the variables and methods common to all objects of a certain kind. 
* When you create an object from a class, you are said to have created an instance[Object] of the class.

## Example:
*	LAPTOP-monitor, keyboard, mousepad, charger.
*	BANK-manager, clerk, cashier, ATM machine.

## Example classes
* bike --petrol filling,wheel rotate, speedometer, accelator -->activity [function or method]
main activity is [key insertion]

* college -- lab , auditorium, class, canteen,principal
main activity is [open main gate]

* home [main meter on/off]

//.java ->.class
//.class //jvm -> main method.

// method declarations

public static void main(String[] args){
    //use of 'static' keyword
    //object  -combination of state and behaviour
    //behaviour -method
